                    <p class = "lead">The Stock Price has increased over time with sharp increases around 2012, 2015 and 2018.  
                        These changes can be attributed to many factors that can impact stock prices, but the biggest factor is the movies and television industry.
                        As Disney bought more properties and franchises, they were able to responsibility for more of the yearly box office. As more movies become 
                        popular, the greater the desire for merchandising and theme park incorporation. For example, after Guardians of the Galaxy franchise became
                        popular, the Mission: Breakout Ride was added to a few theme parks to encourage more visitors. As more movies/franchises become possible, look for 
                        more additions that potentially increase revenue.

                        Disney has had several landmark years that have encouraged stock holders to invest even more money into Disney, than ever before. In 2012, "The Avengers" 
                        was released and caused people to become even more interested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a key reason why Disney's stock is as high as it is now, compared to 
                        what it was in 2010. Disney also bought Star Wars, creating another franchise pillar, which, just like Marvel, impacts movies, theme parks and merchandise sale. 
                        In November, Disney released Disney Plus, a streaming library that contains countless Disney movies and shows. The excitement of a new streaming service caused people to
                        become more confident in the future prospects and we expect stocks to exponentially increase over the next five to ten years, regardless of COVID-19.
